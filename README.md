# Weather App

It's an IOS project written in Swift. The challenge is to develop a weather application following some of the rules of [clean architecture](https://pusher.com/tutorials/clean-architecture-introduction) and a large test coverage.

If you have any feedback I would love to hear it!

## How to build

The project uses Cocoapod to manage dependencies, so to build the project you will need:

```
# git clone https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp
# cd WeatherApp
# pod install
# open WeatherApp.xcworkspace
```

The first time you build the project it'll fail and ask you to enter the Open Weather API Key, you can get one [here](https://openweathermap.org/api)

Here a brief description of the main topics:

## Architecture

The architecture has these layers:

- **ViewController**: Subscribe to ViewModel Combine Publisher to get the data or send events.

- **ViewModel**: Create view representable objects using a mapper and responses to ViewController events.

- **Interactor**: Different use cases and business logic.

- **Repository**: Repository pattern to choose between different data providers.

- **DataProvider**: Get the data from data sources.

I've used Dependency Injection to allow testing.

## Swift

The minimum developer target is iOS 13 because the project uses **Combine** and **Compositional Layout**.

## UI

I've used UIKit because I don't feel confident with SwiftUI yet to do something a bit complex, for example, Compositional Layout [ðŸ‘€ class](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/main/WeatherApp/Module/Weather/ViewController/WeatherCollectionViewLayout.swift).

I've implemented a basic Dark Mode with Appearance Proxy and Color Set catalogue.

If you'd like to see some screenshots, the files created during snapshot testing is a good place [ðŸ‘€ folder](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/tree/main/WeatherAppSnapshotTests/Module/Weather/__Snapshots__/WeatherViewControllerSnapShotTests)

## Tests

I've added [TestSpy](https://github.com/f-meloni/TestSpy) util tool. This helps to create spy objects, records calls and assert some conditions.

I'm using [Sourcery](https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery) to auto-generate spy objects, [ðŸ‘€ build script](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/main/Scripts/Build-Phases/sourcery.sh)

There are four different test targets:

- **WeatherAppUnitTests**: Unit tests, all of them are using spy objects.

- **WeatherAppIntegrationTests**: Integration tests, they're using HTTPStubProtocol to provide STUB network responses globally, then check how the ViewModel behaves.

- **WeatherAppUITests**: UI tests, they're using a launch environment tag to set up the APP before the start. Here we have two types of tests:
  
    -- UI Testing: These tests are checking that the view is shown as expected when the ViewModel emit an event (Success/Error)
  
    -- System test:  End to end, black box tests. they are launching the application as it is and performing some actions to check their results at the UI layer.

- **WeatherAppSnapshotTests**: Snapshot tests're basic tests of the main screen comparing snapshots and recursive description of the UI. [ðŸ‘€ snapshots](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/tree/main/WeatherAppSnapshotTests/Module/Weather/__Snapshots__/WeatherViewControllerSnapShotTests)

The project is integrated with Jenkins and [Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/) and the pipeline runs tests after detecting new commits in parallel on nine different devices:

- Simulators: iPhone SE 13.6, iPhone SE 14.0, iPad Air 2 13.6, iPad Air 2 14.0.  [ðŸ‘€ fastfile](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/36dac4ae30a752a81a2db7ea256d2d093525edcd/fastlane/Fastfile#L20)

- Physical Devices: iPhone 12 14.1, iPhone 11 Pro 13.4, iPhone 11 14.0, iPad Air 4 14.1, iPhone SE 13.4. See [ðŸ‘€ build script](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/36dac4ae30a752a81a2db7ea256d2d093525edcd/Scripts/browserstack.sh#L34)

## Code Quality

The project is integrated with [Sonar Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=rmaqueda_WeatherApp). The seven hours of technical deb detected by Sonar is because the test function names are not compliance test_given..._when..._then.... I'll figure out how fix it.

This's the dashboard:

    </a>
</p>

SwiftLint is set up in all targets. [ðŸ‘€ rules](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/main/.swiftlint.yml)

I've used [CPD](https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_cpd.html) to detect duplicate code blocks automatically inline.

## Continuous Integration

I've used Fastlane to simplify all the build and test commands. [ðŸ‘€ Fastfile](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/main/fastlane/Fastfile)

I've added the project to my own Jenkins instance and set up a basic pipeline to test the project and set the status in Github. [ðŸ‘€ Jenkinsfile](https://github.com/rmaqueda/WeatherApp/blob/main/Jenkinsfile)
